A wild attempt to port xv6 to Python.

I'm taking a top-down approach, mocking up the layer below the one I'm working
on at any given time.

At some point, this will converge with Cleese.


STATUS:

Other than sh and usertests, the stuff in pyv6/bin (the user-space commands) 
have had their first pass conversion.

The actual system calls those make are mocked up for now.

See pyv6/tests.py for the smoke tests for what I've done so far.

See also translating.txt for some notes on translating C idioms to Python.
